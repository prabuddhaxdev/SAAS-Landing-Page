### About

Originally tasked with replicating just the hero section of [leadpages.com](https://www.leadpages.com), I decided to take things a step further - and ended up engineering a **exact clone** of the entire landing page.

From **fonts, color palette, spacing, layout precision** to **animations and responsiveness**, every visual and functional detail has been meticulously reproduced. The goal? A **one-to-one replica** so precise, you might have a hard time spotting the difference.

Think of it as a front-end teardown brought to life — rebuilt from scratch using modern dev practices.

> Go ahead, open both side by side. If you notice any difference, it’s probably in the URL.
